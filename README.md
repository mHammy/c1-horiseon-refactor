# Horiseon-Refactor

## Description

- My motivation for this project was solving the problems presented before me and enabling me to learn new methods of code.
- I worked on this project due to the existence of problematic code within the base website code.
- Through a few edits, I was able to make the website accesibility compliant to the best of my knowledge and the code semantic for future development.
- I learned many new tags through researching semantic tags and use cases. I also realized, sometimes it's best to tackle problems in short bursts as opposed to all at once.
